## üìå Project Title: Robotic Arm for Pick & Place Task

### üìç Overview
This project involves automating a **pick and place task** in a manufacturing process using a **robotic arm (manipulator)**. The simulation is performed using **RoboDK** software, while **MATLAB's Robotics Toolbox** is used for trajectory planning, velocity profiling, and kinematics verification.

### üéØ Objectives
- Select a suitable **robotic arm** based on degrees of freedom, workspace, and payload.
- **Simulate** the robotic arm in **RoboDK** to perform pick and place tasks.
- Implement **trajectory planning** with waypoints between start and end positions.
- **Verify kinematics** (forward & inverse) using **MATLAB** with/without the Robotics Toolbox.
- Analyze **velocity profiles** of joints and the end effector.
